> Master Supabase essentials by building a real-world sales dashboard with authentication, real-time data operations, and secure user management.

Supabase is a serverless backend service provider and an open-source Firebase alternative. It provides developers with a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, Storage, and Vector embeddings.

It allows you to build highly optimized and performant applications using Postgres backend with little configuration.

<h2>What you'll build</h2>
You’ll create a complete sales dashboard application that manages deals across a sales team. The app features user authentication with role-based access along with a visualization of aggregated sales deals for each rep, updating in real-time as new deals are added. Scalable user profiles are automatically created upon signup using database triggers, and all data is secured with permission-based filtering. This project demonstrates how to build a production-ready business application with proper user management, data visualization, and security.
